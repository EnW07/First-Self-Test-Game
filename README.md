Hi! My name is EnW. This is my first ever published game project that I intend to ACTUALLY finish. I published it with main mechanics already finished, but I want to polish it as much as possible and maybe
adjust some changes, add several levels, maybe some lore, music, sounds, and etc. I'm pretty new in developing games even though I have wanted to do it in a very long time. If there are any questions or suggestions
please feel free to contact me!
